It is a great way to see in real time how many subscribers are on your YouTube channels without always going to your channel to see. Checking your phone every few minutes to see if you’ve gained any followers is gauche, and perhaps more to the point doesn’t let you show off when you’ve got visitors over. In the modern era, the up-and-coming social media star needs a stylish way to display just how popular they are for the world to see.
